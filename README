# SubwayEdit
Tool to edit Subway Surfers data files. You can change the number of coins, number of keys, of boards, etc. You can 
probably also completely ruin the settings file by editing some of the more obscure settings. 

And yes, this is cheating.

Root access required.

# File format of playerdata file:
 Offset Size Content
 0000   0004 Hash size (0x0014)
 0004   0014 SHA1 hash of salt + file after offset 0x001C
 0018   0004 Length of rest of file (filesize - 0x001C)
 001C   0004 0x0001 (maybe file version?)
 0020   0004 Number of key/value strings
        1-2  Length of first key
             Characters of first key
        1-2  Length of first value
             Characters of second value
 
        1-2  Length of second key
        (etc)
 ...
        0004 Number of key/number pairs
        1-2  Length of first key
             Characters of first key
        0004 First value (32-bit value)
        1-2  Length of second key
        (etc)
 ...
        0004 Number of key/number pairs (second set)
        (etc)
 ....
 
All 4-byte numbers are high-endian (least significant byte first)
All string length fields are as follows.
If the length is less than 128 (0x80) bytes, only a one byte length field is used.
Else, the first byte is (length XOR 0x7f) + 0x80. The second byte is the length divided by 0x80.
